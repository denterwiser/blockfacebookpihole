# blockfacebookpihole

I'm trying to take comprehensive lists of facebook's services and adapt them so I can put them into pihole. I'm not experienced with coding. If you can fix anything, please jump right in! This is meant to be as comprehensive as possible in blocking facebook's servers.

* https://github.com/jmdugan/blocklists/tree/master/corporations/facebook
* https://www.github.developerdan.com/hosts/
* https://github.com/anudeepND/blacklist/blob/master/facebook.txt

Developer Dan suggests that we combine his list (https://www.github.developerdan.com/hosts/lists/facebook-extended.txt) with anudeepND's facebook list (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/blacklist/master/facebook.txt) for full coverage.

I'm not sure if I'm allowed to combine these lists as per their licenses, so I'll likely start by just converting them from hosts file format to blocklist format.
